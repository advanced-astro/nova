### Astro Component

This component is included with the Astro Starter Kit.

### Usage

You can import the component where you need and use it like this:

```jsx
---
import Gallery from '@components/Gallery.astro';
---

<Gallery
	name="gallery"
	images={[
		{ src: 'https://unsplash.it/1080?random=1' },
		{ src: 'https://unsplash.it/1080?random=2' },
		{ src: 'https://unsplash.it/1080?random=3' },
		{ src: 'https://unsplash.it/1080?random=4' },
	]}
/>
```

If you only have 1 gallery on a page, the `name` property is optional. For pages with multiple galleries, make sure each one has a unique name so the Lightbox only includes images from the correct gallery.
