This component is available with the Astro Starter Kit.

### Supported Icons

This component pulls icons from the `src/icons` directory. To add more, simply add your icons as individual SVG files to this directory.

### Usage

Import the component where you need it. From there, you can pass in the filename (without the extension) of the icon you want to use, like this:

```html
---
import Icon from '@components/Icon.astro';
---

<Icon name="arrow-right" />
```

### Styling

By default, icons are set to be `1em` width and height. For one off changes, you can add a class to the icon.

```html
<Icon name="arrow-right" class="w-auto h-6" />
```

If you want to update the global default, see the component code below. You can update the styles set in the `<style>` block.
