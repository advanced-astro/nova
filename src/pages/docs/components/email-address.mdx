This component is available with our Astro Starter Kit. It's a utility component that helps prevent spam. It'll reverse the email address in the source and display it correctly using CSS. It also handles copying by unreversing the text on copy.

### Usage

Import the component on the page or component you need, like this:

```jsx
---
import EmailAddress from '@components/EmailAddress.astro';
---

<EmailAddress email="hello@example.com" />
```
