This component is available with our Astro Starter Kit. You don't need to copy it.

### Supported Sites

As needed, we'll add more to this list, but for now the sites we usually tend to link to are supported:

-   Facebook
-   Twitter / X
-   Instagram
-   LinkedIn
-   TikTok
-   Youtube
-   Pinterest

### Usage

Before you use this component, be sure that you've added the social media links you need for your site to `src/site.js` in the following format:

```js
export default {
	...otherConfig,

	/**
	 * Social Links
	 */
	social: {
		facebook: 'https://www.facebook.com/',
		twitter: 'https://twitter.com/',
		instagram: 'https://www.instagram.com/',
		linkedin: 'https://www.linkedin.com/',
		youtube: 'https://www.youtube.com/',
		pinterest: 'https://www.pinterest.com/',
		tiktok: 'https://www.tiktok.com/',
	},
};
```

Now you can import the component into the page or component you need it and use it!

```jsx
---
import SocialLinks from '@components/SocialLinks.astro';
---
<SocialLinks />
```

## Style Variants

You can choose from 3 different styles for the links:
- Default: Coloured icons with no background
- Circle: Coloured circled with icon inside
- Rounded: Coloured rounded square with icon inside

```jsx
<SocialLinks />
<SocialLinks variant="circle" />
<SocialLinks variant="rounded" />
```

## Including or Excluding Links

By default, all links will be shown. You can specify which links you'd like using the `only` or `except` props.

These props accept an array of site names, like this:

```jsx
<SocialLinks only={['twitter', 'facebook']} />
```

In this example, the `only` prop tells the component to display only Twitter and Facebook links.

```jsx
<SocialLinks except={['twitter', 'facebook']} />
```

In this example, the `except` prop tells the component to display all available links, except Twitter and Facebook.
