This component is available with our Astro Starter Kit.

## Usage

Before you use this component, be sure that you've added the opening times to `src/site.js` in the following format:

```js
export default {
	...otherConfig,

	/**
	 * Opening Times
	 */
	openingTimes: {
		mon: '09:00 - 17:00',
		tue: 'Closed',
		wed: '09:00 - 17:00',
		thu: '09:00 - 17:00',
		fri: '09:00 - 17:00',
		sat: '09:00 - 17:00',
		sun: 'Closed',
	},
};
```

Now you can import the component into the page or component you need it and use it!

```jsx
---
import OpeningTimes from '@components/OpeningTimes.astro';
---
<OpeningTimes />
```

The current day of the week will be highlighted. To change the styling, you can edit the `OpeningTimes.astro` file. The class applied is on line 24:

```jsx
x-bind:class={`{ 'font-bold': today === '${day}' }`}
```
