## Install Astro Starter Kit

```bash
npx degit resknow/astro-starter-kit my-site
cd my-site
npm install
```

The components available in Nova build on top of the Astro Starter Kit. Install the Astro Starter Kit before you start using Nova.

The Astro Starter Kit comes with a set of UI components that you can use to build your site. These components are built using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [AlpineJS](https://alpinejs.dev) and are fully customizable.

They are also used heavily in the examples provided here.
